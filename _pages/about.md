I am a second‑year Master’s student in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Zac Manchester](rexlab.ri.cmu.edu). My research focuses on algorithms for simulating, planning, and controlling contact-rich and high-dimensional robotic systems. My expertise lies in numerical optimization, deep learning, and control. **I am currently applying for Ph.D. programs in Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, and Computer Science.**

Previously, I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) in 2022, where I was advised by [Ye Zhao](https://lab-idar.gatech.edu/) and [Matthew Gombolay](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/people/matthew-gombolay/). My undergraduate research focused on trajectory optmization and multi-agent reinforcement learning.
