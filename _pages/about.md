I am a firstâ€‘year Ph.D. student in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Zac Manchester](rexlab.ri.cmu.edu) and a research intern at the [Robotics and AI Institute](https://rai-inst.com) working with [Simon Le Cleac'h](https://simon-lc.github.io), [Preston Culbertson](https://pculbertson.github.io), and [Jiuguang Wang](https://www.robo.guru). Previously, I received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from [Gerogia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu) and a M.S. in Robotics from [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu). My Master's thesis can be found [here](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/app/uploads/2024/08/CMU_MSR_Thesis-2.pdf).

## research
I'm broadly interested in modeling and decision-making for robotic systems through the lens of numerical optimization and machine learning. In particular, my current work focuses on accelerating numerical methods for solving challenging tasks such as humanoid control and whole-body dexterity.
