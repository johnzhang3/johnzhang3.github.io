I am a second‑year Master’s student in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Zac Manchester](rexlab.ri.cmu.edu). My research focuses on simulation, control, and learning algorithms for contact-rich and high-dimensional robotic systems.

Previously, I received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Tech in 2022, where I worked with [Ye Zhao](https://lab-idar.gatech.edu/) and [Matthew Gombolay](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/people/matthew-gombolay/).
